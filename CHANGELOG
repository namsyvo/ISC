## 0.3.1
- Make several minor changes.
- Improve memory usage: put read info and alignment info into shared variables.
(Re-organize code: put related parameters and variables together in structs,
and put code for initializing memory to functions on structs.)

## 0.4
- Call new SNPs from alignment with known alleles (postponned)

## 0.3
- Use randomized algorithm with one index as the main strategy.

## 0.2.3
- Use deterministic search for alignment step.

## 0.2.2
- Use one index for alignment step.

## 0.2.1
- Add call SNPs quality calculation

## 0.2
- Work with pair-end reads. Consider reverse complement of reads.
- Add indexing phase to main program.
(Re-organize code, test modules, test data.)

## 0.1 Initial version
- Implement seed-and-extend strategy to align reads to the multi-genome. Work with
 single-end reads, no reverse complement. Allow only known SNPs.
- Implement algorithm to calculate distance between reads and the multi-genome.
- Build reference multi-genome
