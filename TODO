- Calculate SNP quality after finishing alignment step.
    + Read allele frequency from SNP profile (VCF files).
    + Store all SNPs at each position found from read-multigenome alignment.
    + Calculate SNP quality based on Bayesian method.
- Work with fmi package:
    + Integrate new fmi package to reduce memory usge and test it.
    + Implement goroutines for saving indexes in new fmi package.
- Reduce memory usage of alignment phase
