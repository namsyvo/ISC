(1) For 0.7.4 version: prepare to release the first public version.
    + Fix a possible bug related to accessing ref_pos_map in alignment.go in LeftAlign and RightAlign functions.
    + Adjust quality of variants in output based on the best evaluation.
    + Refine output (add info to missing columns in VCF format).
    + Add functions to allow IVC working with single-end reads.
    + Filter indels at beginning and end of reads more carefully.

(2) Integrate indexing and SNP calling phases:
    (a) Create or load the index:
        + Create the index only if (A) it does not exist, or (B) it exists but there is an error loading it.
    (b) Call SNPs.
    (c) Save the index (both FM and SNP indexes) if the index was created newly.
        + Tell users that the program has finished calling SNPs so they can go ahead to look at the result.
        + The program can go ahead to save the index (FM and SNP) while users are looking at the results.
