(1) Calculate SNP quality after finishing alignment step.
    + Read allele frequency from SNP profile (VCF files).
    + Store all SNPs at each position found from read-multigenome alignment.
    + Calculate SNP quality based on Bayesian method.

(2) Integrate indexing and SNP calling steps:
    (1) Create or load the index:
        + Create the index only if (A) it does not exist, or (B) it exists but there is an error loading it.
        + Currently, the program will recreate the index every time if the index is larger than 1 GB (due to size limit for loading file in Golang).
    (2) Call SNPs.
    (3) Save the index (both FM and SNP indexes).
        + Tell users that the program has finished calling SNPs so they can go ahead to look at the result.
        + The program can go ahead to save the index (FM and SNP) while users are looking at the results.

(3) Call new SNPs and new alleles:
    + Generate new simlated reads with new SNPs and new alleles (0.1%, 0.5%, 1%).
    + Modify the traceback algorithm to call new SNPs with current distance calculation algorithm (that is, calling only exist alleles).
    + Modify the distance calculation and traceback algorithms to call new alleles (and new SNPs as well).

(4) Exploit the advantage of pair-end reads:
    + Difference(first match, second match) is small.
    + Distance(read, ref) is small.
    + Matches are in reverse strands.
