(1) For 0.7.3 version: Further decrease FP, increase TP, reduce runtime & mem
    + Consider mapping quality.
    + Filter unreliable indels at beginning and end of reads.
    + Try better scoring scheme.
    + Reduce runtime and memory usage.

(2) Integrate indexing and SNP calling phases:
    (a) Create or load the index:
        + Create the index only if (A) it does not exist, or (B) it exists but there is an error loading it.
    (b) Call SNPs.
    (c) Save the index (both FM and SNP indexes) if the index was created newly.
        + Tell users that the program has finished calling SNPs so they can go ahead to look at the result.
        + The program can go ahead to save the index (FM and SNP) while users are looking at the results.
