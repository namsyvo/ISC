(1) Evaluate performance with both simulated and real reads.

(2) Finish some back work:
    + Read fully allele frequency from SNP profile (VCF files).
    + Improve reading input (take names of index files from index directory), writing ouput (follow VCF format with more information).

(3) Integrate indexing and SNP calling phases:
    (1) Create or load the index:
        + Create the index only if (A) it does not exist, or (B) it exists but there is an error loading it.
    (2) Call SNPs.
    (3) Save the index (both FM and SNP indexes) if the index was created newly.
        + Tell users that the program has finished calling SNPs so they can go ahead to look at the result.
        + The program can go ahead to save the index (FM and SNP) while users are looking at the results.

(4) Call new SNPs and new alleles:
    + Generate new simlated reads with new SNPs and new alleles (0.1%, 0.5%, 1%).
    + Modify the traceback algorithm to call new SNPs with current distance calculation algorithm (that is, allow only known alleles at known positions).
    + Modify the distance calculation and traceback algorithms to call new alleles (and new SNPs as well).

(5) Exploit the advantage of pair-end reads:
    + Difference(first match, second match) is small.
    + Distance(read, ref) is small.
    + Matches are in reverse strands.
