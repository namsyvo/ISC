(1) Working with diplod data (detect both homozygous and heterozygous variants)
    + Generate data which capture diploid variants.
    + Implement data structures which capture diplod variant profiles
    + Implement Bayes's formula for diploid variants.

(2) Improve running time and memory usage.
    + Working with Phred-scale values directly instead of probability.
    + Use base quality fully in alignment.

(3) Other improvements.
    + Make well-format output, adapt to full-info input.
    + Adjust quality of variants in output based on the best evaluation.
    + Filter indels at beginning and end of reads more carefully.

(4) Future work
    + Add functions to allow IVC working with single-end reads.
    + Allow new alleles.
    + Working with some cancer datasets.

(5) Integrate indexing and SNP calling phases:
    (a) Create or load the index:
        + Create the index only if (A) it does not exist, or (B) it exists but there is an error loading it.
    (b) Call SNPs.
    (c) Save the index (both FM and SNP indexes) if the index was created newly.
        + Tell users that the program has finished calling SNPs so they can go ahead to look at the result.
        + The program can go ahead to save the index (FM and SNP) while users are looking at the results.
