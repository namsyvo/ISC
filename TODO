(1) Call known deletions:
    + Adjust code to capture known deletions in alignment.
    + Report all types of variants.

(2) Reduce runtime and memory

(2) Finish some back work:
    + Read fully allele frequency from SNP profile (VCF files).
    + Improve reading input (take names of index files from index directory), writing ouput (follow VCF format with more information).

(3) Integrate indexing and SNP calling phases:
    (a) Create or load the index:
        + Create the index only if (A) it does not exist, or (B) it exists but there is an error loading it.
    (b) Call SNPs.
    (c) Save the index (both FM and SNP indexes) if the index was created newly.
        + Tell users that the program has finished calling SNPs so they can go ahead to look at the result.
        + The program can go ahead to save the index (FM and SNP) while users are looking at the results.
